New Jersey Riparian Zone Map—DRAFT 

According to the Flood Hazard Area Control Act Rules 

Prepared by Kate Douthat, CRSSA, Rutgers University 

Revised April 23, 2024 

 

Map Description 

 

This map shows the locations and widths of regulatory riparian zones to the streams of New Jersey. This map uses the stream classifications from Surface Water Quality Standards (N.J.A.C. 7:9B) to locate the riparian zone of regulated waters according to Flood Hazard Area Control Act (FHA) Rules (N.J.A.C 7:13-4.1). This map does not include other regulated riparian buffers or areas, such as those stipulated in the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act Rules. 

 

Terms of Use and Disclaimers 

 

The streams and riparian buffer data set that forms the basis of this layer is intended to serve as a resource for analysis or planning purposes and does not replace formal regulatory delineations of jurisdictional riparian buffer areas. These GIS layers reflect the stream classifications, anti-degradation designations adopted as of the publication date, and the locations of endangered and threatened species known of the publication date. This map is supplemental only and is not legally binding.   The regulatory extent of a riparian buffer at any particular location or on any property may be established by obtaining a Flood Hazard verification as described at N.J.A.C 7:13-5.1 

The NJDEP may change the stream lines based on more in-depth analysis and field inspection for regulatory purposes. This data includes a digital representation of New Jersey's Surface Water Quality Standards in accordance with "Surface Water Quality Standards for New Jersey Waters" as designated in N.J.A.C. 7:9 B. The line-work has been broken/altered to reflect the descriptions specified at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.15. When interpreting the stream classifications and anti-degradation designations, the descriptions specified in the SWQS at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.15 always take precedence.  

The riparian buffer layer represents buffer distances as described at N.J.A.C. 7:13-4.1(c) and are approximations of the extent of these features.  Site conditions along a stream or on a particular property will determine the actual extent of the buffer. Small ponds that do not intersect the stream network do not have a buffer representation in this map. The ponds may be connected by a small, unmapped stream. Regulated waters draining into mapped waters will often carry the same riparian zone designation as the mapped water.   

This data set also includes a digital representation of stream stretches valued by habitat for threatened or endangered plant and animal species that are “critically dependent on the regulated water for survival” based on the confidential records kept by the Natural Heritage Program and the Landscape Project. Critically Dependent on the regulated water or watercourse (CDW) represent a subset of species identified as endangered or threatened under the Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act (N.J.S.A 23:2A-1 et seq.) or those that are identified as endangered pursuant to the Endangered Plant Species List Act (N.J.S.A. 7:5C-5.1).  Species on this CDW list have been determined by the Department to be susceptible to habitat changes associated with alteration of existing hydrologic conditions, stream flows or flooding regimes. Consistent with the Flood Hazard Area Control Act Rules at N.J.S.A 7:13-4.1(c)2 jurisdictional streams flowing through suitable present or documented habitat for such species and the stream reach 1 mile upstream of the suitable habitat will receive a riparian buffer of 150 feet.  For mapping purposes, all Landscape mapped habitat for CDW species is assumed to feature suitable habitat.  The mapped extent of riparian buffers based on CDW species documentation should be considered approximate and is subject to modification based on field conditions for regulatory purposes.

Version Notes 

 

Updates in this revision 

 

Streams adjacent to Landscape Project CDW polygons were also considered as CDW habitat. Previously stream polygons running through CDW habitat were not coded as E&T habitat because they were not labeled as such in the Landscape Project data. Please check the streams that are not included to affirm that it is the correct level of inclusivity.   

The HUC14 boundaries are not at the same resolution/updated to match the 2015 streams. As a result, some streams are represented as originating or terminating in different HUC14s, which does not accord with the concept of a watershed. In these cases, small portions streams upstream from C1 waters would not be labeled as being upstream of C1 waters because they exit the HUC14 boundary in GIS. To remedy this, short stream segments that extended beyond the HUC14 boundary, apparently due to differences in resolution, were coded as C1 upstream. There may be still be a few cases of issues with the C1 upstream coding due to the HUC14 lines, but it was corrected in most cases.  

All SWQS and E&T classifications and upstream selections were regenerated and checked.  

Unregulated polygonal areas were amended according to previous discussions. NOT marked as unregulated: Stormwater basins, pipelines, NHD ditches. 

Unregulated canals were identified using the “Canals and raceways” layer 

Polygonal waterbodies were split more accurately so that flowlines with different riparian zone widths in different portions are better represented.  

 

 

Mapping Riparian Zones According to Flood Hazard Area Control Act Rules 

 

Classifications and Riparian Zone Widths 

 

The Flood Hazard Area Control Act (FHA) Rules are used in conjunction with Surface Water Quality Standards (SWQS) classifications and Landscape Project classifications to locate the riparian zones of regulated waters using existing GIS data. Only freshwater classifications from SWQS were used in the mapping. Streams used by Endangered or Threatened Species Critically Dependent on the Regulated Water (CDW) are identified from the NJDEP Fish and Wildlife Landscape Project 3.3 map. Flood Hazard Area Species Critically Dependent on Water designates if a species is considered “critically dependent on the regulated water for survival” according to the Flood Hazard Area Control Act rules at N.J.A.C. 7:13. Classifications and corresponding FHA rules are shown in Table 1.

Note that SWQS direct classifications and upstream classifications are mutually exclusive in the maps. For example, if a stream segment is “Category 1”, it will not also be labeled as “Contributes to C1 stream”, even if the segment meets the upstream criteria of the FHA. This notation system is intended to make clear the primary reason for the given riparian zone width. 

 

Some streams or waterbodies do not have a regulatory riparian zone according to the FHA because they are not regulated waters/areas as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:13-2.2 and 7:13-2.3. It is important to identify unregulated streams and reaches before calculating upstream reaches to prevent upstream reaches from being identified for unregulated streams. Additional potentially unregulated areas that are difficult to positively identify in GIS have not been labeled as “unregulated”. GIS definitions for unregulated streams are presented in Table 2 and summarized here:

Buffer placement and shape 

 

According to N.J.A.C. 7:13-4.1 (b), buffer location is measured landward from the top of bank. The best estimate of this location is from waterbodies in NHD 2015. Polygons in NHD 2015 represent estuaries, ponds, lakes, and streams greater than 30 ft across. Buffers are calculated from centerlines for smaller streams and from NHD 2015 polygons where they exist.  

According to the FHA, the riparian zone is perpendicular to the stream at the downstream end, and rounded the buffer distance around the stream at the upstream end: one flat end and one round end. However, that was difficult to execute in GIS, so all buffer polygons have two round ends. Some waterbodies have flowlines with different classifications in different parts of the water bodies. If waterbodies have flowlines with different buffer widths, whenever feasible, those waterbodies are split by buffer widths. In cases when it is not feasible to split the waterbodies, such as waterbodies with many tributaries or braided streams, the riparian zone width is determined by the width of the majority of the overlapping stream flowlines. 

 

Summary of notes and caveats to the creation of these maps 

 

This map of regulatory buffers is based on the current published Surface water Quality Standards (SWQS) map (Edition 20200327). However, the SWQS map is based on an outdated stream dataset rather than the current best available authoritative stream lines: (National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) 2015 Streams in New Jersey, Edition 20220401). For this riparian zone map, we approximated the locations of the SWQS segments on NHD stream segments as best as possible within the scope of the task. Surface Water Quality Standards were aligned to NHD 2015 streams, but areas with braided streams or very different linework still had alignment problems. This translation process may have created inaccuracies in the position of the SWQS relative to the NHD 2015 streams. SWQS should be updated to match the authoritative stream dataset at which point upstream segments can be recalculated. 

The NHD 2015 streams were used as a network to trace upstream according to the regulations. A small number of topological errors in the streamlines needed to be repaired in order to use the lines as a functional network to do upstream analysis. These repairs result in a s small number (< 100) instances of differences between the traced lines and the authoritative lines. Topology errors (self-intersections) in the published NJ NHD 2015 stream lines should be corrected to facilitate trace network applications. Likewise, there may be a small number of problems due to mis-coded stream directions. If stream flow direction is mis-coded in the streams layer, the segment will not properly be captured in the upstream trace.  

The HUC14 boundaries are not at the same resolution/updated to match the 2015 streams. As a result, some streams are represented as orginating or terminating in different HUC14s. In these cases, small portions streams upstream from C1 waters will not be labeled as being upstream of C1 waters because they exit the HUC14 boundary in GIS. This can be amended if the HUC14 boundaries are updated, but for the present this is allowed to happen, in the interest of consistency with the current GIS HUC14 boundaries. 

The FHA rules stipulate that certain streams have buffers for one mile upstream. In graph theory, this is called an isodistance. The isodistance is calculated by summing successive line segments. Using the existing stream network, distances will never equal exactly one mile due to the natural shapes of the streams and the way the GIS data is stored. This problem was addressed by subdividing the stream flowlines into 264’ segments, 1/20th of a mile. Therefore, the one mile upstream was traced 1mile plus up to 264’, or 5%, longer than one mile.  

The FHA rules stipulate that buffers be measured from the top of bank. This is not feasible in GIS currently, but top-of-bank could be estimated from fine-resolution LiDAR data in the future. Buffers could then be located more accurately from the top-of-bank lines.  

Buffer polygons do not have flat ends at the downstream end of a classified segment. This issue is relatively minor when looking at the whole system as the end of a buffer around a segment is rarely depicted. Flat ends can be created manually as a final step if needed. There may also be a lack of accuracy in the buffer size and shape for waterbodies that contain flowlines with multiple different classifications. This is mostly an issue for lakes, ponds, and estuaries.  

Some waterbodies have flowlines with different buffer widths. Whenever feasible, those waterbodies are split where the flowline changes buffer widths. Waterbodies were not split when the flowlines were not perpendicular to the banks (in lakes and reservoirs) or in waterbodies with many tributaries or braided streams close together.  

Waterbodies that do not intersect the stream network do not have a buffer representation. Unmapped regulated waters draining into mapped waters will often carry the same riparian zone designation as the mapped water, so small, isolated ponds are left unclassified to avoid mistaken classifications.

Overview of procedure to create riparian zone maps 

 

Align SWQS to NHD 2015 streams  

Assign classification code to each stream segment using the following data: 

SWQS 

T&E Critically Dependent on a water source 

Plants from Natural Heritage Program Biotics Database. Stream flowlines and waterbodies within 300’ of a species observation were selected. This database is confidential, so was performed by a DEP staff member, and streams were shared without Biotics information.  

Animals from Landscape Project: Species marked Critically Dependent on the Water Source and stream flowlines for mussels. Use polygons to select intersecting streams. 

Expand Landscape Project FHASCDW polygon selections 

Include adjacent stream polygons 

Include adjacent lake/pond polygons 

Landscape Project stream lines for mussels.

Riparian zones exist along both sides of every regulated water and include the regulated water itself, except as provided at N.J.A.C. 7:13-2.3(c)1. The extent of a riparian zone is determined in accordance with (b) through (h) below. 

(b) The portion of the riparian zone located outside of a regulated water is measured landward from the top of bank. 

(c) The width of the riparian zone is as follows: 

1. The width of the riparian zone along any regulated water designated as a Category One water, and all upstream tributaries situated within the same HUC-14 watershed, is 300 feet;

i.     The Atlantic Ocean; 

ii.    New Jersey’s barrier island complex; 

iii.   Any lawfully existing manmade lagoon; 

iv.   Any lawfully existing stormwater management basin or wastewater treatment pond; 

v.    Any segment of a regulated water enclosed within a lawfully existing pipe, culvert, or bridge; and 

vi.   Any lawfully existing, manmade open channel that was created to convey stormwater, provided the channel is fully lined with manmade impervious material, such as a concrete low-flow channel within a stormwater basin or a ditch completely lined with concrete or asphalt. 

 

Stream Banks 

 

The portion of the riparian zone located outside of a regulated water is measured landward from the top of bank. "Bank" means the inclined side of a channel, an excavated or impounded area or a topographic depression, which confines and/or conducts water.

Email from Leigh Lager, 3/29 2023, to Kate Douthat 

 

I’m the data steward on record as you have figured out.  And the poor sucker who got the odious job of hand coding the standards back in the day. 

 The standards are on the backbone of nhd 2002.  When I say backbone, I mean backbone.  We don’t generally use the NHD like it was intended with all the fancy bells and whistles.  If you’ve ever read the surface water quality standards rule, the written explanations of where and what category a stream is (which are the legally binding part) are convoluted and kinda awful to interpret in some places.  That said……when I did this….. 

 I got an early cut of the nhd from our BGIS once it was ready so I could start doing the work 

Because some of the standards reference large areas or areas that I had access to a good gis layer, I combined those polygons, keeping every attribute and then intersected that layer with the nhd layer to ‘break’ the line segments at certain places.  I want to say the pinelands boundary, some federal lands, some state parks and some other stuff I can’t remember without looking it up were used.  

Once I programmatically ‘split, divided, broke’ the line segments (use whatever term you want), I had to go through each entry in the standards and find where they were talking about.  

Once I was pretty confident I found where they were talking about, I coded the line segments in question with the correct attributes.  If I recall correctly, the line segments in nhd go confluence to confluence and have com id’s.  None of that mattered to me because standards are not based on confluences in a lot of cases, and I’m absolutely certain comid’s weren’t on my radar because I don’t use them.  As I said….I used the backbone (line spaghetti).  If the listings said something like ‘from headwaters to railroad bridge’ or ‘pine street to rt. 80’……I hand ‘broke’ the lines at those crossings.  I pulled up the roads layer, the aerial layer and split the segment where I needed.  And….that is where we now differ from NHD.  

There were lots of splits for road crossings and railroad bridges and other weird things that were done by hand to get me the segment I needed to match the standards.  I did not do roads in the big batch initially because that would produce a buzzillion tiny little segments I didn’t need.  

After the initial release of that version, there were other versions over the years, but all were based on the same backbone.  I may have had to do some programmatic splitting (there was some big federal piece of land down the shore that I know I did that way), or I may have had to do more hand splitting to update for the latest round of c1’s.  

 So…back to your question…..I’m gonna say, unless you do some type of linear referencing or some other magic I haven’t had to learn, you can’t do what you want.  Breaking the line segments did make the swqs layer incompatible with the nhd, in my eyes.  

 And now onto the Larry part….. “I’m working with Rutgers University to create a regulatory Flood Hazard Act riparian buffer layer among other things.  Since Category 1 and Trout Production waters play a large role in the creation of this layer”………….BE VERY VERY CAREFUL doing this.  Multiple programs have tried to do buffer layers.  I’m not a fan unless someone really knows what they are doing with this stuff.  I’ll explain why.  The standards are based on stream centerlines.  When you get a ‘fat’ stream, and you do a buffer based on the centerline, you either have to buffer much bigger than you want to get the correct distance on the bank, or you buffer solely from the centerline with the regulatory distance and risk not hitting the bank at all.   That problem can be dealt with if you have waterbody delineations for that stream and buffer from the bank.  However, the last time I looked, the polygons for streams didn’t extend up into the smaller reaches.  So, in those instances, your over or under estimation isn’t as great, but still exists.  To top it off, when you buffer, you have to be really cognizant of the ends (straight vs. rounded) and really really cognizant of areas where standards change.  It isn’t that this a bad idea at all………..I’m just pointing out whoever does this work had better be willing to do some hand editing (which is a bigger job) and not just rely on the magic of gis. 

 That said, I’m not new at this and kinda cranky as I’ve seen multiple times what can go wrong when assumptions are made.  There may be a better way to handle things now.  I’m willing to answer any and all questions on the subject of the swqs layer creation and attempts to build buffers.
